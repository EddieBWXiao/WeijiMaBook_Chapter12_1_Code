# WeijiMaBook_Chapter12_1_Code
Code written when studying the book, Bayesian Models of Perception and Action (Ma et al., 2022)

Basically showing some figures that might help with 12.1

BayesBook_Transition_Marg.m => visualising the transition function

BayesBook_12_1_simu_ChangeNoise.m => inference when transition function is known (and has analytical expression)

BayesBook_12_1_simu_MisestNoise.m => misestimation -- observer assumes measurement noise constant
